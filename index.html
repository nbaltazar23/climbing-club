                        <p>I used to be scared of heights but rock climbing has always drawn my attention. I went climbing at a gym once and saw a group of people having a good time climbing and it turned out to be this climbing group. I wanted to be a part of this community so I signed up. The support I've received when starting out and conquering my fears is unlike anything I've felt before. Not one regret since joining.</p>

                        <p>I was new in town but am considered to be an avid climber. When I got to San Diego, I did not climb much because I did not have anyone to climb with. I went to a gym and saw a flyer about this group to come to a climbing meetup. I met a lot of cool people here and climbers of my skill level too! Since then, I've been going to every event thrown and haven't regretted it since.</p>
